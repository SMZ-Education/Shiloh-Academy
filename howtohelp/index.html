            <h1>Volunteer Opportunities Overview</h1>
            <p>We're a small team of five looking for extra hands in various areas. If you're interested in making a difference, here's how you can help:</p>
        </section>
        <section class="volunteer-areas">
            <div class="volunteer-area">
                <h2>Educational Volunteers:</h2>
                <p>English and French Teachers: If you're proficient in English or fluent in French, come teach at our school. We also welcome art, music, and dance teachers. A minimum commitment of one month can significantly impact our students, providing them with invaluable learning experiences.</p>
                <p>Subjects and Skills: No matter your language, some subjects are best taught through demonstration. Your expertise can offer our students a broader perspective and new skills.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="volunteer-area">
                <h2>Agriculture and Farming:</h2>
                <p>Vegetable Gardening: Join us in growing vegetables on our school property to feed the children and staff. Any surplus is sold for extra income or traded for other necessities. This project is open to both experienced and amateur gardeners and farmers. It's an opportunity to contribute to our food security efforts while enjoying the tranquility of our location.</p>
                <p>Animal Farming: We're involved in poultry, fish, and pig farming, contributing to our self-sufficiency and educational programs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="volunteer-area">
                <h2>DIY and Construction Projects:</h2>
                <p>We have a variety of DIY projects around the property, from building playground equipment and green walls to constructing outdoor cooking facilities and plant nurseries. Volunteers can stay for as little as a week to help with these improvements.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="volunteer-area">
                <h2>Accommodation for Volunteers:</h2>
                <p>Our volunteers are accommodated in our guest house, which offers single, double, group rooms, and a family suite. Although we provide housing in exchange for services rendered, we ask for a small contribution toward airport pickup and electricity costs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="volunteer-area">
                <h2>Images of our Area:</h2>

                <img src="/Images/image5.webp" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="volunteer-area">
                <h2>Sustainable Practices and Produce:</h2>
                <p>Fruit and Vegetable Processing: We generate additional income by selling and processing fruits and vegetables, turning them into products like juices and syrups.</p>
                <p>Sustainable Farming: To reduce food costs, we manage a mango orchard, grow vegetables year-round, and raise chickens. We also raise pigs, though their meat is not used for school meals due to religious considerations; instead, it helps fund other food purchases.</p>
                <p>We welcome individuals who want to contribute to our cause, offering a fulfilling experience while making a tangible difference in our community.</p>
