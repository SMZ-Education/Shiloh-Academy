                <h1>A Pressing Challenge</h1>
                <p>For the past few years, Senegalese youth have been leaving the villages of Senegal to try to reach Europe on fishing boats. Many died trying; others were returned home by European border police. This has not discouraged them; even COVID did not.In the face of these adversities, Shiloh Academie has emerged as a beacon of hope, bringing the "American Dream" closer to home. </p>
                <p>Since its creation in 2019, Shiloh Academie has been dedicated to transforming the educational landscape in the village of Gandigal, located just on the fringe of the bustling resort area of Saly, Senegal. By providing access to quality preschool and primary education, we aim to give our students the skills and knowledge they need to build successful futures without having to leave their homeland.</p>
                <p>Our mission goes beyond traditional education; we try to equip the youth of Senegal with a sense of empowerment and self-reliance. By creating a good and stimulating environment, we encourage our students to dream big and work hard towards achieving their goals. Through our programs, we hope to create a generation of leaders and innovators who will drive positive change within their communities and beyond.</p>

                <h1>Our School</h1>
                <p>We offer breakfast and lunch every day at a small cost to parents, and some students can attend for free because we own our building, so our main costs are just for food and teachers. Alongside our school, we have a farming project that helps us keep the cost of vegetables and meat low.</p>
                <p>Our approach to education is inspired by American schools, which we believe helps children grow up with a love for their country and a desire to stay here. At the moment, we teach up to the fifth grade in primary school, and we hope to expand to a full high school in the village eventually.</p>
                <p>Children who would normally not start school until they were 12 years old are now able to begin their education earlier because our school is close to them. The nearest public school is almost two miles away and only offers education from grades 1 to 5, with classes of over 100 students each. This school runs on a split schedule, with half the students attending in the morning and the other half in the afternoon, leading to high dropout and failure rates. These public schools do not offer a path to further education after grade 5.</p>
